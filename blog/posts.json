I really enjoy the team aspect of it, a lot more than Apex or Fortnight, which I still can't wrap my brain around. Also a very big fan of playing competitive matches, I feel I'm pretty good, but always working on getting better. I wrote a little wrapper for an overwatch api that will display some basic stats below, this is just on my xbox account."
