Since the end of Season 8, the Overwatch community has been buzzing about the evolving role of the Tank. A common consensus among players and developers is that tanks no longer feel as durable as they once did. This often forces both Support heroes to focus solely on keeping the Tank alive, limiting gameplay options and strategies for everyone involved.

With the shift to a 5v5 format, the role of the Tank was intended to be more aggressive and dynamic. However, this shift has also introduced challenges. Tanks still rely heavily on consistent healing to maintain their presence on the battlefield. Effective teamwork between Tanks and Supports has become even more crucial, emphasizing the need for strategic coordination and communication.  Solo-queuing as a Tank in Overwatch 2 offers a unique challenge, encouraging players to develop strong situational awareness and adaptability, especially when working with varying levels of support experience. Duo-queuing, where a Tank and a Support player team up, has emerged as a popular approach to enhance synergy and overall gameplay experience.

Internal stats support this sentiment. A new metric called "tankiness" was introduced in Season 9 to measure the number of deaths a hero experiences compared to expected deaths. This metric shows that almost all heroes, especially tanks, have become less durable since Season 9. While some game-wide changes, like the reduction in headshot damage on tanks, have helped, tanks still need to be more durable.

The developers are debating whether to make broad, systemic changes or targeted adjustments to individual heroes. They favor the latter, as individual changes can dramatically improve a hero's effectiveness and reinforce their unique characteristics. For example, increasing Reinhardt's shield health is a targeted change that enhances his "tankiness" and fits his hero's fantasy.

The balance team is gearing up to roll out a game-changing patch that will significantly boost "tankiness" through targeted hero adjustments. Set to launch around mid-Season 11 or Season 12, this update promises to reinvigorate the Tank role and elevate the overall gameplay experience. Stay tuned for more details from the Overwatch development team â€“ exciting times are ahead for Tank players!
