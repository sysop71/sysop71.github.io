Blizzard’s [Defense Matrix update](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24173281/defense-matrix-keeping-overwatch-2-fair-and-fun-for-every-player/) is a testament to their unwavering commitment to preserving the fairness and fun of Overwatch 2. By cracking down on cheaters and toxic behavior, the update reinforces the integrity of the game. Since its launch, 800,000 accounts have been banned for using cheats like aimbots and wall hacks, and Blizzard is redoubling their efforts with new tech to detect and disable hacks even faster. High-ranked players and content creators in regions like Korea, Japan, and North America are being targeted by cheaters, and Blizzard is actively working on solutions to prevent them from stalking specific players. Your role in this is crucial. If you spot a cheater, your report can make a difference. Every skill level matters in keeping the game clean, and your vigilance empowers you to contribute to this effort.

Blizzard is tackling smurfing to keep matchmaking fair, where experienced players dominate lower ranks. A new system, designed to ensure fairness, will quickly adjust matchmaking ratings (MMR) for seasoned players on fresh accounts, pushing them to their actual skill level. New accounts will also play against AI bots for their first five games, making it easier for newcomers to learn the ropes without getting stomped. This system has been tested live and is set to improve matchmaking across all skill levels.

Toxic behavior in chat? Blizzard’s machine learning tech is stepping up. It scans voice and text chat for disruptive behavior, leading to chat restrictions, suspensions, or bans for repeat offenders. Reports matter, and now you can report directly from the scoreboard for quick action. Remember, your reports are crucial in maintaining a positive gaming environment. Overwatch 2 thrives on sportsmanship and teamwork, so lift up your teammates, show respect, and help build a community where everyone feels welcome.
