Season 15 is just around the corner, and the buzz is real. The team is building on last year's wins—from rebalanced gameplay to a fresh competitive system—and there's even a hint of something big coming during Overwatch 2 Spotlight that you won't want to miss.

The recent rank reset, while it may have initially felt disruptive, has actually provided a fresh start for both newcomers and longtime players. This reset has allowed for a more balanced distribution of skill tiers, giving everyone a chance to climb the ranks. Looking ahead, expect further tweaks in how players are slotted into ranks, with the top tiers opening up a bit more so that more folks can chase that Champion title.

Another exciting development is the ongoing testing of the 6v6 mode, where teams are composed of two tanks, two damage, and two support heroes. While it may not have gained as much popularity as the traditional 5v5, the initial results have been promising enough to spark plans for a mini-competitive season midseason. This mode could potentially become a regular feature in the future, adding a new dimension to the game while the core game continues to embrace the classic format.

On the map side, Clash maps are temporarily removed from ranked play. After hearing your feedback about issues like rushed matches and confusing mechanics, the decision was made to remove them from competitive modes. They'll still be available in Quick Play while the team works on making the experience more balanced and enjoyable.
