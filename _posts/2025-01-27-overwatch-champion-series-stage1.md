## Overwatch Champion Series Stage 1

The [Overwatch Champion Series (OWCS)](https://esports.overwatch.com/en-us/news/owcs-2025-stage-1) returns in 2025 with exciting updates designed to enhance the competitive scene and viewing experience. This year’s format features four competitive regions: North America, EMEA, Asia, and China. Each region begins with an Open Qualifier to determine which teams advance to the Regular Season, joining Partner Teams already seeded in the competition. Regional Playoffs will decide the top two teams from each region to compete in the Champions Clash, held at the Hangzhou Esports Center in China.

Hero Bans, a significant addition this season, is a new feature introduced in Stage 1 to add a layer of strategic depth to matches. Teams can ban one hero per map, alternating roles to maintain variety. Once a hero has been banned twice in a series, they cannot be excluded again, ensuring dynamic gameplay throughout each match. Hero Bans will apply to all Stage 1 competitions, including the Champions Clash.

The 2025 season also brings nine Partner Teams representing the best of Overwatch esports. These organizations benefit from revenue-sharing through branded in-game cosmetics, allowing fans to support their favorites. The Partner Teams are:

- North America: [Spacestation](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Spacestation_Gaming), [Team Liquid](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Team_Liquid)
- EMEA: [Gen.G](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Gen.G_Esports), [Twisted Minds](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Twisted_Minds), [Virtus.pro](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Virtus.pro)
