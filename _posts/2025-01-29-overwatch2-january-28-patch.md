![Overwatch2 Quickplay Bots](https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blta12828c588a192aa/5cf15dedcf7aa6330ac66a05/wrecking-ball-screenshot-004.jpg?auto=webp)

Blizzard has [introduced AI-controlled](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/#patch-2025-01-28) bots in Overwatch 2's Quick Play to create a smoother experience for brand-new players. For their first five matches, new players may face AI opponents instead of real ones, allowing them to learn the game mechanics, experiment with heroes, and get comfortable with gameplay flow before diving into full PvP lobbies. This change is designed to reduce frustration for newcomers who might otherwise be placed against far more experienced opponents, especially those using alternate accounts (smurfing).

For players creating new accounts despite already having experience, the update includes a new matchmaking system that rapidly adjusts their MMR (Matchmaking Rating) based on their performance. This ensures that skilled players are identified quickly and placed into appropriately challenging matches instead of spending time stomping on lower-ranked lobbies. In other words, those who create alternate accounts will climb to their actual skill level much faster, reducing the frequency of experienced players facing genuine beginners. This not only benefits new players but also ensures a more competitive and fair environment for experienced players.

This update is a significant shift for Overwatch 2's matchmaking, as it attempts to solve one of the game's long-standing issues: smurfs ruining the experience for true newcomers. By adjusting MMR more efficiently and introducing bots for the first few matches, Blizzard aims to make the game more welcoming while preserving fair competition for new and experienced players. Additionally, the requirement to unlock all other modes has been reduced from 10 to 5 matches, a change that will make new players feel less overwhelmed and more eager to explore the game.
