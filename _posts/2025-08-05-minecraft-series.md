Starting something new this week.

I’ve been wanting to structure my Minecraft play a bit more—and turn it into something that’s fun to follow, whether you’re watching live or catching up later. So I’m kicking off a new series that’ll run across both Twitch and YouTube, built around a simple goal: take a plains village and grow it into a fully functioning, self-sustaining trading hub.

This isn’t hardcore mode. I'm not looking to punish myself. Just trying to play intentionally, build things that make sense, and bring a little order to the chaos that usually happens when I load into a new world.

## Stream & Episode Info

I’ll be live twice a week:

🗓 **Wednesdays and Fridays**
🕛 **Noon to 3 PM CST**
📍 [twitch.tv/sysop71](https://twitch.tv/sysop71)

Each session will get cleaned up and edited into a tighter YouTube episode—more focused, less wandering around sorting chests. You’ll be able to find those here:

There’s also a calendar if you want to keep track of what’s coming up:
📆 [sysop71.com/calendar](https://sysop71.com/calendar/)

And I’ll be maintaining a series page with the episode list and links as they go up:

## What’s in Season 1

The idea is to build out the world piece by piece. Some episodes will focus on gathering and survival basics, others on building out farms or laying out infrastructure. You’ll see the progress, start to finish.

Planned episodes include:

- Seed scouting and getting started
- Carrot and potato farms
- Villager breeder setup
- Bamboo fuel system
- Sugar cane farm and librarians
- Iron farm
- Trading hall and profession districts
- Base layout and early build phases

Basically: progress with purpose.
