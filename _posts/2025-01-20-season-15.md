## Overwatch Season 15: What to Expect as the New Chapter Begins

As Overwatch players gear up for the launch of Season 15, excitement and anticipation are building. Here's a breakdown of what's in store based on key insights from Blizzard, recent reports, and community announcements.

## Season Transition Without Downtime

There will be no off-season break between competitive seasons. Season 14 ends on Thursday, February 28, at 4:00 p.m. PST, and Season 15 kicks off immediately afterward. This seamless transition allows players to dive straight into their placement matches without waiting.
Blizzard has steadily shortened the off-season gap in recent years, moving from several days to hours between seasons.

## Rewards for Season 14 Participants

Players who completed their placement matches in Season 14 can look forward to the usual array of end-of-season rewards:

- Sprays and Player Icons: Automatically unlocked after logging in.
- Competitive Points (CP): Based on the highest Skill Rating (SR) achieved during the season, ranging from 65 CP for Bronze to 1,750 CP for Grandmaster.
- Top 500 Rewards: Exclusive animated sprays and additional player icons for the top-tier players in each region.

## What's New in Season 15?

Season 15 is bringing more than just a fresh leaderboard reset. Overwatch Game Director Aaron Keller has hinted at exciting updates, including a global celebration tied to Overwatch's return to China:

- Lunar New Year Skin Bundles: Players worldwide can expect cosmetics inspired by Chinese mythology, further enriching Overwatch's vibrant skin collection.
- China-Specific Events: Returning players in China will have opportunities to earn exclusive, previously unavailable Mythic skins. While these events are region-specific, they underscore Blizzard's commitment to celebrating the global Overwatch community.

## Looking Ahead

With new cosmetic bundles, themes, and potentially new playable content on the horizon, Season 15 promises to offer fresh opportunities for players to enjoy Overwatch. Whether you're grinding for SR, collecting the latest skins, or exploring new gameplay features, there's something for everyone this season.
