## February Minecraft Drops: Chickens and Cactus Flowers

Minecraft players, get ready to dive into the whimsical world of the first game update of 2025. This update brings a delightful assortment of new features to test in both Java snapshot and Bedrock beta/preview versions. The changes are just whimsy enough to spark fun questions such as "What came first, cold chicken or blue egg?"

One of the standout features of this update is the introduction of two new variants of chicken, bringing colorful life to the expansive biomes of Minecraft. The "cold chicken," with its beautiful blue-gray feathers and ability to lay blue eggs, thrives in the chillier biomes. In warmer sandy biomes, the "warm chicken," with its brown plumage similar to the texture of the eggs it lays, adds a new level of chaos and fun. These new chickens will significantly enhance the biodiversity of the game and provide just that much more entertainment throughout the Overworld.

As part of expanding the game's flora, the update adds the cactus flower, a pink bloom that adds color to the sandy deserts. Beyond its beauty, the cactus flower serves practical purposes: it attracts bees, can be used to create dye, and adds aesthetic value to players' builds. It also brings dry grass in two variants — short and tall — that can be bonemealed. Newly planted, it's even a bit green, a nice touch to the surrounding arid landscapes, and acts as fodder for sheep, like its green counterpart.

With many more interactions and some color to the well-known landscapes, these highlights offer a new option of content for both fans of the original game and newcomers to delve into and enjoy.
