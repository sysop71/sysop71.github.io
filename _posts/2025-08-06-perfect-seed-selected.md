Stream #1 is complete — here's how I found the perfect seed for Season 1, and why this spot is going to be home.
<!--more-->
The first stream of Season 1 is in the books, and it was all about one thing: finding the perfect seed to kick off this world right.

I spent about an hour exploring a curated list of ten promising seeds. Each one had some potential — a decent village here, some cool mountains there — but I was looking for something specific. I wanted a plains village near mountains, something with character and a view that could carry a whole season of builds, farms, and storytelling.

I ranked them all from 1 to 10, narrowed it down to my top three, and after taking a closer look... one stood out. Big time.

It’s not close to spawn — I had to travel over 5,000 blocks — but when I got there, it just clicked. There’s a quiet little village tucked in behind this massive formation I’ve started calling **The Lonely Mountain**, and just beyond that, the snowy, jagged peaks wrap around a small meadow biome like something out of a fantasy novel. It’s remote, it’s beautiful, and it’s got everything I need to build something special.

I’ve already set up camp outside the village and gathered enough early resources to get going — full iron gear, tools, and a solid start. From here, things are only going to get more interesting.

This world is going to be the backdrop for everything coming in Season 1 — farms, villagers, big builds, maybe even a few surprises. The YouTube series kicks off with a curated look at this seed-hunting adventure, so if you missed the stream, that’s where you’ll want to start.

Thanks to everyone who hung out during the stream — and if you didn’t catch it live, keep an eye out for Episode 1 dropping soon.
