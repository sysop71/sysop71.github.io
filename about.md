### Overwatch2

I main tank on this game, my top three are Reinhard, Orissa and D'Va. I will run Reinhardt when a big shield is required, but I will swap off to D'Va or Orissa depending on the opposing tank pick. I will swap to D'Va if there is a Bastion, Ramattra, Hazard or Mauga on the opposing team. Lately I have started swapping to Zarya when the opposing team runs Orissa, but I will often switch to D'Va for her. Finally I will swap to Winston if the opposing team runs Symmettra.

There are edge cases where I may run Mauga or Rammattra, this typically depends on what I am experiencing within my own team composition. Those choices are almost always looking at the amount of damage and if we feel as a team it makes sense.

Tanks I don't play because I struggle with their physics are Hammond and Sigma. These tanks I have struggled with since they were released and I don't get the same output on those I do with my traditional picks.

Tanks I just won't play are Doom, Roadhog and the newly released Hazard, it's just too easy to counter each of these.
