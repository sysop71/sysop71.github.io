## Early Gaming

Originally this was like a autobiographical thing, then I realized nobody cares about that! I started gaming A LONG TIME AGO, but in this galaxy. First experience was with a friends Atari 2600 around 1981, and it was fun. But for me, I was all about the arcades, Pac-Man, Galaga and the like then there was Dragon's Lair and Mach 3 which were so much fun.

## Computer Gaming

For Christmas in 1984 my uncle bought me a Commodore 64, and I was all about those early computer games. My first was Zork, but I have a whole stack of games from back then, so many hours wasted, so much fun had. Then I got into programming the thing, so I was reading Compute's Gazette, and another mag that I can't remember, learning to write programs, and hand typing in the bytecode for several others.

## PC/Console Gaming

The first computer I had that was able to play video games, akin to what is played today, was a Zenith Z-star 486. I upgraded it from 2mb to 4mb's of RAM, this allowed me DOOM. This was/is my favorite game franchise by far, more time has been spent being ripped to shreds in that game, than anything else. I also played Duke Nukem, but it was a platform game at the time, and Wolfenstein which felt like a Doom knock-off to me.

My first console was the Sony Playstaion, and spent a lot of time playing Crash Bandicoot. Then picked up a Wii because my daughter wanted to play the bowling and tennis games, followed by the Wii-U which was nice but a little disappointing.

Currently own 3 Xbox consoles, a 360, an Xbox-One s, and an Xbox-One X. The current game of choice is Overwatch, but Minecraft is a close second, I have a lot of fun building things in Minecraft.
