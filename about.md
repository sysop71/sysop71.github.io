Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm not just a gamer; I'm a passionate gamer and small streamer who's been building and battling my way through video game worlds since the early days of Doom. Whether you're here to learn more about me, share some gaming stories, or join the fun, I'm excited to have you along.

My gaming adventures began with the original release of Doom, a game that ignited my love for first-person shooters. Occasionally, I fire it up again to relive the nostalgia and excitement of blasting through those iconic levels. From Doom, I moved on to Quake, where LAN parties became a staple of my weekends. Those memories of setting up clunky old PCs, connecting cables, and competing with friends still make me smile.

These days, my go-to game is Overwatch. I've played it consistently since 2018, and it has become a cornerstone of my gaming life. Overwatch, with its team-based strategy and dynamic gameplay, is where I truly shine. I love stepping into the Tank role to protect my team, though I'm always up for supporting when needed. The game truly shines when I play with friends, share laughs, and execute coordinated plays. That sense of teamwork is what keeps me coming back.

When I'm looking to relax or flex my creative muscles, Minecraft is my haven. I've been crafting and exploring since 2017, initially sharing the experience with my son. While he's moved on to Fortnite, the memories of us playing together still make me smile. I still find joy in shaping my little corner of the world, whether building elaborate structures or just soaking in the tranquility of a pixelated sunset.

Of course, my gaming repertoire doesn't stop there. If the mood strikes, you might find me diving into Baldur's Gate 3 for some epic storytelling, returning to the vast realms of World of Warcraft, or exploring the depths in Subnautica. Occasionally, I'll hop into Fortnite or Apex Legends for a change of pace, and on rare occasions, I'll revisit the Halo series for a bit of nostalgia. Still, Overwatch and Minecraft remain my mainstaysâ€”the games that feel like home.

As a small streamer, I'm about building a welcoming and supportive community where gamers and creators can connect. Whether you're here to watch some gameplay, chat about our favorite titles, or share streaming tips, I hope my little slice of the internet feels like a place you can call home. Let's build something extraordinary together!
