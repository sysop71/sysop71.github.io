| Intro & Seed Criteria                |      00:11 |    01:31 | This was captured from VOD so may want to pull the transcript as the voice audio is very quiet |
| Reviewing 10 Seeds                   |      01:38 | 01:07:29 | This was captured from VOD as well, most likely want to speed this up and quickly mention highlights from each seed |
| Top 3 Breakdown                      |   01:07:32 | 01:16:09 | This was captured from VOD as well, discussing the top 3 |
| Journey to Final Location            |      50:00 | 02:18:56 | This was captured from OBS, a large amount of travel that ends at the point our title screen was captured |
| Village Exploration                  |  02:19:00  | 02:25:06 | This was captured from OBS, exploring the village, ends with sorting out initial storage and getting ready to do some resource gathering at the lonely mountain |
| Lonely Mountain Resource Gathering   |  02:25:54  | 02:31:09 | This was captured from OBS, collected iron and coal from the mountain and at times the mountain goats were right in my face! I also came face to face with the first Illager of the season! |
| Iron Gear & Tools                    |  02:32:17  | 02:37:57 | This was captured from OBS, arrived back at the village at night, started smelting all the iron and did some light investigating of a potential mining location, a large opening below the village that leads into caves |
| Closing Thoughts                     |  02:38:00  | 02:38:41 | This was captured from OBS, just a short outro, thanks for watching etc |

The intro part is probably usable, it may just sound quiet compared to everything else.

The seed hunt was about an hour, so really should be sped up with a voice over, seed highlights are below.

The top 3 breakdown is about 10min, which means it would take up half the video so not sure we want that as-is, it might be better to just have the top 3, sped up with a VO talking about the other seeds, before picking the seed for this series.

The journey definitely should be sped up, not sure there is much to really talk about, we picked over villages as we went on our way, realized about halfway we had our coords backwards so had to change directions, wound up arriving at the mountain range instead of the village outside the lonely mountain. I think there was a Pillager Outpost around the mountain range, I seem to recall seeing one, but not sure.

Village exploration was several minutes nothing terribly exciting not sure it needs to be in there at all.

Resource gathering was entertaining, about 6min of hopping, ore mining and avoiding the goats.

Smelting down the iron took a long time so maybe as we smelt up the iron we talk about what's up coming up next.

Closing thoughts were pretty simple.

Here are the seeds that I chose from and some quick notes about each.

| Rank | Seed                 | Highlights |
|------|----------------------|------------|
|  1   | -4543703337287058603 | This seed required a hike of 5k blocks to get to, and had an amazing ring of mountains around two seperate biomes, there was also a solitary mountain standing between that and a small village |
|  2   | -3797324408095114320 | This seed had an amazing mountain range nearish to spawn that had a lower mountain inside the range backed by a river |
|  3   |  3330674015811202167 | This seed had a mountain range very close to spawn, which was in a badlands biome, with jungle on either side, with a forest, so several biome's very very close |
|  4   | -3585326117461105373 | Another range close to spawn with a large forest basin |
|  5   | -2903962998698145714 | This range wasn't snowy so the height was lower, but a nice prarie biome in the basin |
|  6   |  4055904822269383545 | This range was very large, with a nice forest biome in the basin |
|  7   |  3064344534284188434 | This range had a snowy biome in the basin, but very large lush cave with deep dark biome below |
|  8   | -4322997180488923102 | This was a smaller range with a meadow biome in the basin |
|  9   |  4897597049515560519 | A large mountain range not in a snowy biome, with a large forest biome in the basin that opens onto a river |
|  10  |  1020648330932050254 | This was a group of mountain ranges in the savanah biome, with two Pillager Outposts nearby |

### 🧱 Intro & Series Setup (00:11 – 01:31)

Hey folks — welcome to Season 1 of my Minecraft Survival Series. This isn’t just any playthrough — I wanted to build something special. Something immersive, with a cinematic feel, and a location that could carry an entire season of stories, builds, and gameplay.

To do that, I started by looking for the perfect seed. My goal was a plains village near mountains — ideally something scenic, something that felt alive. And I didn’t care if it was close to spawn — I was willing to hike for it.

---

### 🌱 Reviewing 10 Seeds (01:38 – 01:07:29, speed up)

I checked out ten different seeds — each one had potential. Some had great terrain but no village, others had the right biomes but didn’t quite feel right.

Here are a few highlights:

- **Seed 10** had a series of savanna mountain ranges — and even a couple of Pillager Outposts — but didn’t hit the right vibe.
- **Seed 5** had a beautiful prairie basin, but it lacked height and contrast.
- **Seed 3** was close to the top — it had a badlands spawn, jungle, and mountain range all packed together.

But three of them really stood out.

---

### 🏔️ Top 3 Seeds + Final Decision (01:07:32 – 01:16:09)

After narrowing it down, I was left with three strong contenders:

- **Seed 3**: A multi-biome mountain range with jungle, forest, and badlands — really unique.
- **Seed 2**: A great river-backed mountain range not far from spawn.
- And **Seed 1**: A lonely mountain guarding a village, backed by jagged snowy peaks and a meadow. But it was over 5,000 blocks from spawn.

And that’s the one I picked.

The travel wasn’t going to be easy, but the landscape? Totally worth it.

---

### 🚶 Journey to the Build Site (50:00 – 02:18:56, speed up)

I set out from spawn, trekking through several villages and biomes — and somewhere along the way, I realized I had my coordinates backwards. Classic move.

Eventually, I arrived at a massive mountain ring, and spotted what looked like a Pillager Outpost. But my destination was just beyond that — a quiet little village nestled near what I’m calling **The Lonely Mountain**.

---

### 🏡 Village Arrival & Exploration (02:19:00 – 02:25:06)

The village itself isn’t huge, but it’s peaceful. A good spot to settle while I prepare to build.

Behind it stands the Lonely Mountain — and just past that, the snow-capped peaks surrounding a meadow biome. It's stunning, and it feels like home.

---

### ⛏️ Resource Run at Lonely Mountain (02:25:54 – 02:31:09)

Once I got settled, I climbed the mountain to gather some early resources — iron and coal mostly — while dodging mountain goats. At one point, they got *right* in my face. Oh, and I ran into my first Illager of the season — just a quick hello.

---

### ⚒️ Iron Gear & First Plans (02:32:17 – 02:37:57)

Back at the village, I smelted everything down and geared up in full iron. There’s a large cave system under the village that I’m keeping an eye on — could be promising.

And now that I’ve got some protection, I can really start laying the groundwork for what’s next.

---

### 🎬 Outro & What’s Next (02:38:00 – 02:38:41)

Thanks for joining me on the journey to find this seed. In the next episode, we’ll get our early farms up and running — carrots, potatoes, and maybe even start prepping for villagers.

If you enjoyed this, hit subscribe — and I’ll see you in Episode 2.
