                <p class="subtitle has-text-grey">Early Years</p>
                <p>I was born in Kansas in 1971 and we moved to California when I was three years old. I spent my entire
                  childhood going to the beach on the weekends, riding my bike everywhere and just generally being
                  outside. Shortly after my arrival back to Kansas, my uncles bought me a Commodore 64 and I never
                  really looked back.</p>
                <p class="subtitle has-text-grey">Nerd Years</p>
                <p>Most likely this is from high school on, I was in the band at school, did solo competitions and won a
                  few awards for trumpet solo. In college, I was a music major, switched around a few times, and was
                  offered a job at a local tech company for $20k/yr so left the college life.</p>
                <p class="subtitle has-text-grey">Adult Years</p>
                <p>I've worked for several copmanies through my career, early on (before y2k) I was a certification
                  trainer. I switched to a technical college and did that for a few years, again teaching tech, but
                  without the heavy focus on certification.</p>
                <p>About 12yrs I caught a break and was hired into a regular IT job at the Univeristy of Kansas and
                  worked there happily for 7yrs. While there I made two life-long friends who really helped me become a
                  much better programmer, really I don't think I would be where I am now if not for those guys. I had
                  about a one year stint at Lowe's where I worked with one of my best-friends and really got my chops
                  working in Azure. After that I was picked up by Rackspace where I've been for the past 3yrs, and it's
                  been glorious.</p>
