# Current List

## Overwatch

I play this game on the Xbox, the PC and my Playstation 4. By far I have the most time on the Xbox, where I think I've clocked nearly 20 days of playtime. I really enjoy the team aspect of it, a lot more than Apex or Fortnight, which I still can't wrap my brain around. Also a very big fan of playing competitive matches, I feel I'm pretty good, but always working on getting better. I wrote a little wrapper for an overwatch api that will display some basic stats below, this is just on my xbox account.

## Minecraft

I play this game on the Xbox, the PC and my iPhone, and I'm really looking forward to the Minecraft Earth game. A lot of my more creative work is done on the Java edition, most likely because it's more personal, whereas the bedrock edition on Windows and Xbox I tend to play with my son. I currently run some minecraft servers, and I may be inclined to share that information here at some point in the future. I'd also like to display achievements and stuff here, but I need to wrap my brain around the Xbox API, the docs are kind of all over the place with no really good examples for jQuery, and I don't feel like writing C# for something simple.
